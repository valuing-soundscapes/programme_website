    "text": "When at a music festival, the things we generally think of are music, mud, and manky portaloos; festivals rarely bring to mind the surrounding nature at the site.\n\n\nMembers of the Valuing Nature’s Soundscapes team from the University of East Anglia took time away from their deskbound lives to encourage festivalgoers at Latitude to think beyond the sounds of the festival to the surrounding natural soundscapes. Among the many stalls, activities, and crowds, we set up our ‘Sound Lab’, where we exposed festivalgoers to sounds of nature and asked how it made them feel.\n\n\n\nIncreasingly, children are growing up with less opportunity for interactions with the natural world. We wanted to cultivate curiosity and encourage a deeper connection with nature – and sound is a great way to do this. We aimed to introduce the over 350 children (and their parents) who visited our Sound Lab to concepts of acoustic ecology and encourage them to think about the soundscapes we experience every day, and how this can affect how we feel.\nWe attempted to give the children an immersive acoustic experience, showing them what sounds can look like using a live spectrogram generator – a tool that visually represents sounds in real-time. Given the festival context of our activity, we gave children a chance to make their own soundscapes using musical instruments, before moving on to soft toys of UK bird species with inbuilt birdsong recordings. This created much excitement among the children as identifiable visual spectrogram patterns of different species’ songs appeared in front of their eyes. We finished the activity by giving the children the opportunity to create a complex species-rich dawn chorus soundscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Butler and Claire Buchan standing awkwardly in the science tent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster created for the activity. Click to enlarge\n\n\n\n\nSounds contribute to our experience of nature, and scientists are becoming increasingly aware of the effects on our wellbeing. While the children inside were making ‘music’, we couldn’t help but do a bit of science.\nWe asked adults to listen to three different soundscapes which varied in the number of species singing and presence of traffic noise. After listening to each soundscape, they were asked to anonymously report how each made them feel. Once we got home (and had a shower), we tallied up the data and were excited to find evidence that species rich soundscapes make people happier than species poor soundscapes, but this benefit is lower if there is road traffic noise in the background:\n\n\n Proportion of respondents scoring each soundscape by how it made them feel. Click to enlarge\n\n\n \nThis underlines the importance of biodiversity in our experience of nature, and makes us wonder what negative consequences biodiversity loss may be having on human wellbeing.\n\n\n\nThis activity was facilitated by the SAW Trust, an education charity that promotes engagement with science through the arts/creativity."

    "text": "The University of East Anglia / British Trust for Ornithology soundscape monitoring project was launched with the aim of uncovering the drivers of spatial and temporal variations in soundscape characteristics.\n\n\n\nThese drivers of variation remain largely unknown, preventing effective targeting of natural soundscape conservation efforts. Since our first acoustic monitoring device was deployed in March 2023, the project has steadily expanded, and now covers 47 active BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) squares across England, Scotland, and Wales (Fig.1). This growing network of volunteer contributions has collected over 7000 hours of audio recordings, providing valuable insights into the dynamic characteristics of the UK’s natural soundscapes.\nThe audio files we collect are analysed to extract acoustic indices that describe soundscape characteristics based on their acoustic properties. Acoustic indices have been shown to correlate with species diversity, vegetation structure, and they have successfully captured circadian rhythms for a range of taxa.\nFor example, the Bioacoustic Index summarises both the volume and frequency range of songs and calls produced by the local bird community. Higher values indicate greater avian abundance and activity, while lower values indicate reduced abundance and call activity (Fig.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 - Locations of acoustic devices currently deployed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2 - Annual (left) and daily (right) variation in the Bioacoustic Index. Daily variation is shown separately for the breeding season (April–July) and non-breeding season (October–February) for 2023 and 2024. The 2023 data is represented by blue lines, and 2024 data by green lines, with lighter shades indicating the breeding season and darker shades indicating the non-breeding season. These are example outputs from a single BBS square which has been monitored continuously since March 2023.\n\n\n\nThe annual and daily variations in the Bioacoustic Index highlight seasonal peaks and troughs in avian vocal activity, corresponding with breeding and non-breeding periods. These graphs indicate that vocal activity was generally higher in 2023 than in 2024, especially during the breeding season. Peak vocal activity was observed during the dawn chorus in both years, with heightened intensity during the breeding season.\nAs well as quantifying their overall acoustic properties, sound files are also run through BirdNET, a free-to-use classifier, to derive species lists for specific times of day throughout the breeding (Apr-July) and non-breeding season (Oct-February) (Fig.3). BirdNET provides a measure of the algorithm’s performance in its prediction for a given species presence in the recording termed as the “confidence” score. For the outputs presented here, BirdNET outputs were filtered to a confidence score of ≥0.9 to increase the probability of correct identification for given species. The classifier generally performs well, but there is capacity for false positives, so detections should not be taken as concrete evidence of presence. However, with ongoing updates and improvements, BirdNET is expected to become a valuable tool for avian monitoring programmes, offering greater accuracy and usability in the future.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3 - Relative detection frequency, calculated as the proportion of days in which the species was detected, during the breeding (Apr-July) and non-breeding (Oct-February) season. These are example outputs from a single BBS square which has been monitored continuously since March 2023.\n\n\n\nThank you to all the volunteers who have been maintaining monitoring devices since 2023, as well as to the new volunteers who have recently joined us. Your contributions to monitoring diverse and unique locations across the UK is expanding our collection of acoustic data, whilst enhancing our understanding of how soundscape characteristics vary across different landscapes and regions. We are deeply grateful for your dedication, which continues to drive the success of this project and strengthens our understanding of the rich soundscapes that surround us.\nWe are keen to expand our coverage by recruiting additional volunteers to deploy and maintain recording devices. If you would like to be part of the University of East Anglia / British Trust for Ornithology soundscapes monitoring project, we’d be delighted to hear from you. We are especially interested in expanding our efforts in Scotland and Wales, so if your Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) square is located in those areas, your participation would be invaluable. Please direct any queries you may have to William Gough at w.gough@uea.ac.uk."

    "text": "This event brings the results of the £6.4 million, UKRI-funded “Economics of Biodiversity” research programme to those involved in valuing and financing biodiversity. It comprises three sessions of talks/panel discussions and an exhibition summarising the findings of the seven funded projects. The talk sessions are organised around three themes: (a) Natural Capital; (b) Valuation of Biodiversity; (c) Green Finance and Decision Making. The exhibition combines poster and video content, aimed at bringing the results to life for policymakers and practitioners. The event will also be relevant to the UK’s hosting in February 2026 of the IPBES Plenary, with its focus on the IPBES Business and Biodiversity Assessment.\n\n\nFor further details about registration, please contact Sue Davis sue.davis@nottingham.ac.uk or Gamze Yakar-Pritchard gamze.yakar-pritchard@nottingham.ac.uk."
